## Loading and Saving Courses

StreetO stores generated courses as either KML or GPX files.

These are standard files and can be loaded and viewed in any GPS application or Google Earth.

The KML files generated are formatted to MapRun's guidelines https://maprunners.weebly.com/course-setting.html

GPX files store the Controls as Waypoints and the generated best route around that course as the track.

File -> Open shows a FileChooser dialog to select a KML or GPX file.

The file the course was loaded from is remembered and changes to the course can be saved to the same location.

File -> Save As saves a copy of the current course to a new location as either a KML or GPX file.
